# Output Data Object/Array into Formatted Table (Swift)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Swift projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table. (No Xcode needed)

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/swift-data2table
  cd swift-data2table
  swift main.swift
  ```
*Data will instantly output formatted to Terminal/Console*
